## Introduction
Computers have become a foundational aspect of the music production industry. Every musical piece that is recorded today makes use of computers to some extent. Whether it is production, recording or distribution, the software has nested itself so deeply into the music production industry it is almost impossible to create musical content without it. This report will focus primarily on the process of producing music using synthesized sounds and effects which is a popular method of music production today. 

The reader of this report should be aware of the two primary software applications being discussed, Virtual Studio Technology(VST) and Digital Audio Workstation(DAW). A DAW is application music producers use to keep track of sound recordings and creations over time. From within the DAW, a producer can simulate keys being played, put effects on sounds, manipulate the timing of instruments and isolate tracks of instruments. This software is the most important application in music production for it is responsible for the majority of tasks in the creation of the song. A VST is a much smaller piece of software that runs on top of the DAW. Often a synthesizer, or audio effect, the VST is simply a plugin for the DAW. These VST’s can be vastly unique in what they do, so it is difficult to bundle all processing aspects of a VST into a single umbrella. For that reason the framework I will be looking at in this report has many features and use cases, too many features to analyze all of them. Specifically, I will be considering features that are mainstream to music information retrieval to get a clear idea of how this library stands up to real-time processing.

### 1)
The project topic is digital signal processing. This is an important topic for the course because signal processing is used in many multi media systems. Both for recording or representing sounds and for transmitting data wirelessly using electromagnetic frequencies. This project will specifically be focused on framework called Juce, which is used in the development of virtual studio technology plugins for music production. Juce is comprised of many different features but in order to stay within the scope of this course I will only document and analyze the Juce library for digital signal processing and will ignore the aspects of the framework that focus on user interface.
### 2)
I have not been able to acquire any performance surveys on the built in functions that exist in the Juce framework, but… There have been some very interesting projects that use the Juce framework to perform unique tasks and challenges. For example an artist that goes by the name of Imogen Heap developed a system that records hand gestures and translates these gestures into signal modifications. A video demonstration of this tool can be found here. On top of interesting projects like this there are some academic papers that describe certain processing / scheduling methods of the Juce framework. These papers do a good job highlighting specific methodologies of the framework but I am more interested in understanding what it looks like to use the Juce framework to create a synthetic signal using sine waves and sine wave mutations.
