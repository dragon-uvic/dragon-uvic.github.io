### 1)
The project topic is digital signal processing. This is an important topic for the course because signal processing is used in many multi media systems. Both for recording or representing sounds and for transmitting data wirelessly using electromagnetic frequencies. This project will specifically be focused on framework called Juce, which is used in the development of virtual studio technology plugins for music production. Juce is comprised of many different features but in order to stay within the scope of this course I will only document and analyze the Juce library for digital signal processing and will ignore the aspects of the framework that focus on user interface.
### 2)
I have not been able to acquire any performance surveys on the built in functions that exist in the Juce framework, butâ€¦ There have been some very interesting projects that use the Juce framework to perform unique tasks and challenges. For example an artist that goes by the name of Imogen Heap developed a system that records hand gestures and translates these gestures into signal modifications. A video demonstration of this tool can be found here. On top of interesting projects like this there are some academic papers that describe certain processing / scheduling methods of the Juce framework. These papers do a good job highlighting specific methodologies of the framework but I am more interested in understanding what it looks like to use the Juce framework to create a synthetic signal using sine waves and sine wave mutations.
